This is my COMP 1004 website project

The project I chose was a calendar application which allows its users to browse a calendar and set events.

Calendar:
The calendar can be controlled through dropdowns in the bottom left corner of the page. The dropdowns control month and year search. The month section selects from the 12 months of the year and the year section is currently only for 2025-2027.

Event saving:
The user can enter a date and a small desciption and save them as a Json file to the users device.

Event reading:
Once an event is save as a file the user can load said file use the choose file button on the left hand side of the page. After loading the file, the date of the event will be marked on the calendar for the user to see
